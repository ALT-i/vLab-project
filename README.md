# Desktop Trivia
A quiz game application created for desktops(i.e Windows, Unix, MacOS, etc). Inspired by one of the projects from Udacity's Full-stack developer course but unlike it, this is a desktop application.

### How it works
This application is created using an electron-react framework, so it consumes data from an already established API. You would have to create your own trivia API with endpoints and data for the electron-react app to work with in order to be fully operational and display data. Check out [Udacity's trivia API](https://github.com/JhimmieC137/Udactiy-Trivia-Project/tree/main/backend) if you need help creating yours. For simple demo, clone my version of the [desktop-trivia's API](https://github.com/JhimmieC137/desktop-trivia-api) and run it simulteanously with the desktop-trivia app. 

Update the server URL details in the `./src/utils.js` file and you should be good to go. 

#### Running the app
To run the application locally, clone the repo. install node.js on your local machine and then install the dependencies by navigating to the root folder in your terminal and running the command `npm install`.

After the installation is complete or successful, start the app with the command `npm start`.

### Updates 
This app is still in it's beta phase, more updates in UI, API, etc., to come.

Cheers
